# CaliDef Collectables

Welcome to the **CaliDef Collectables** repository. This website serves as a visual reference guide for collectors and enthusiasts looking to explore and purchase unique collectibles. Our curated collection offers a glimpse into a variety of items that you can acquire.

## How It Works

While this site allows you to view items available for sale, please note that **purchases cannot be made directly through this website**. To buy any item, you must follow the procedures outlined below:

### Purchasing Options

#### eBay
Most items are available for purchase through eBay. Please follow the eBay links provided with each item to complete your purchase securely.

#### Facebook Messenger
For buyers preferring a more personal transaction:
1. Contact us via Facebook Messenger to discuss the item you're interested in.
2. To ensure buyer and seller protection, initial purchases must be made under the "goods and services" payment option.
3. Only after a successful first transaction, returning customers may opt to use the "friends and family" payment method for subsequent purchases.

## Getting Started

To view the collectibles, clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
